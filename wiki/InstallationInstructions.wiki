==What to do to install DOMinator==

*WARNING:* This is a beta release. Don't install if you don't know what you're doing! If you really want to install it read all the instruction below!

1. download Windows (http://www.wisec.it/testDom/XX_win.zip) and/or
Linux (http://www.wisec.it/testDom/XX_Lin.zip) version of DOMinator
(based on FF 3.6.13). 
If you have a MacOsx there no version yet, sorry.

2. unzip the zip with the password  4dd4457b-aed9-4ab4-8472-2a4b07656ff4
and save it in a directory:
Ex DOMinatorBin.
2.
  a If linux: Enter in the DOMinatorBin directory and launch:
      ./firefox -P DOMinatorProfile -NO-REMOTE 
      this will create a new profile.
  b. if Windows create a link named DOMinator containing 
       ./firefox -P  DOMinatorProfile -NO-REMOTE 
      and double click it.

3. install at least Firebug (v 1.6.2) (I use also web developer and
Firecookie).

4. install attached xpi.

5. open Firebug and set it "On" on any page. 

6. Have a look at the attached image. 

7. go for example to http://www.aol.com or http://www.leboncoin.fr/  and
see what it says.

8. Remember that since Firefox sets the default profile as the last one,
the default one will always be launched using:
{{{
firefox -P default -NO-REMOTE
}}}
*all the Firefox links must be updated with the previous arguments*

9. Read the [http://code.google.com/p/dominator/downloads/detail?name=DOMinator_Control_Flow.pdf&can=2&q= pdf] document for architecture description.

10. See the troubleshooting page for minimal recovering if you did some error.

As a side note consider that there are still some issues I hope to fix,
like doing some kind of rebranding to solve those -P issues on original
firefox.
