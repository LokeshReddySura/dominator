==What to do to install DOMinator==

*WARNING:* This is a beta release. Don't install if you don't know what you're doing! If you really want to install it read all the instruction below!

 # download Windows (http://www.wisec.it/testDom/XX_win.zip) and/or Linux (http://www.wisec.it/testDom/XX_Lin.zip) version of DOMinator (based on FF 3.6.13). If you have a *MacOSX* there no version yet, sorry.

{{{
  a If linux: Enter in the DOMinatorBin directory and launch:
      ./firefox -P DOMinatorProfile -NO-REMOTE 
      this will create a new profile.
  b. if Windows create a link named DOMinator containing 
       ./firefox -P  DOMinatorProfile -NO-REMOTE 
      and double click it.

 # install at least Firebug (v 1.6.2) (I use also web developer and Firecookie).
 # Download and install the Dominator [http://code.google.com/p/dominator/downloads/detail?name=dominator-0.9.0.1.xpi&can=2&q= Extension].
 # open Firebug and set it "On" on any page. 
 # Have a look at the attached image. 
 # go for example to http://www.aol.com or http://www.leboncoin.fr/  and see what it says.
 # Remember that since Firefox sets the default profile as the last one, the default one will always be launched using (*all the Firefox links must be updated with the previous arguments*):
{{{
firefox -P default -NO-REMOTE
}}}
 # Read the [http://code.google.com/p/dominator/downloads/detail?name=DOMinator_Control_Flow.pdf&can=2&q= pdf] document for architecture description.
 # See the troubleshooting page for minimal recovering if you did some error.

As a side note consider that there are still some issues I hope to fix,
like doing some kind of rebranding to solve those -P issues on original
firefox.
