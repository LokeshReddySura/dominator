What to do to install DOMinator:

1. download Windows (http://www.wisec.it/testDom/XX_win.zip) and/or
Linux (http://www.wisec.it/testDom/XX_Lin.zip) version of DOMinator
(based on FF 3.6.13). 
If you have a MacOsx there no version yet, sorry.

2. unzip the zip with the password  4dd4457b-aed9-4ab4-8472-2a4b07656ff4
and save it in a directory:
Ex DOMinatorBin.
2.
  a If linux: Enter in the DOMinatorBin directory and launch:
      ./firefox -P DOMinatorProfile -NO-REMOTE 
      this will create a new profile.
  b. if Windows create a link named DOMinator containing 
       ./firefox -P  DOMinatorProfile -NO-REMOTE 
      and double click it.

3. install at least Firebug (v 1.6.2) (I use also web developer and
firecookie but you know better than me what's useful =).

4. install attached xpi.

5. open Firebug and set it "On" on any page. 

6. Have a look at the attached image. 

7. go for example to http://www.aol.com or http://www.leboncoin.fr/  and
see what it says.

8. Remember that since firefox sets the default profile as the last one,
the default one will always be launched using firefox -P default
-NO-REMOTE  (but you already know that:).

9. Read the pdf document for some insightful help.


As a side note consider that there are still some issues I hope to fix,
like doing some kind of rebranding to solve those -P issues on original
firefox.
