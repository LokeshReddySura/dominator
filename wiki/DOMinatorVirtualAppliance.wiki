#labels Featured,DOMinatorVA
If you want to try it without installing it, Mario Heiderich setup a Ubuntu Virtual Appliance with DOMinator already installed.

Anyone that could not install it because of lack of support for some OS, can try it using VirtualBox.

Consider that this version of DOMinator uses a lot of memory and CPU resources so the
more resources you give to the VM the best DOMinator will run.

You can download it from here:
